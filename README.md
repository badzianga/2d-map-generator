# 2d-map-generator

2D map generator created with C++ and SFML as my assignment.

# Usage
App is used for generating random maps using Perlin noise for terrain and dirt patches and cellular automata for caves. Parameters can be tweaked so map size, caves size, hills, etc. can be changed by user. Generated maps can be exported to CSV files for later usage in other projects.

# DISCLAIMER

This is my first major project written in C++. I still do not understand many of the C++ concepts and the app for sure is inefficient.
Also, I do not own tiles - credit goes to Mojang.
